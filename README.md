## 🚀 Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
In the travel and hospitality industry, customer cancellations cause significant loss of revenue and operational complications. Predicting cancellations can help businesses better manage their resources and improve customer service. In this project, we attempt to build a model to predict whether a holiday booking will be cancelled or not using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Network.

## 📊 Data Collection and Preparation <a name="data"></a>
We used a dataset from the hotel industry, which includes information about bookings, such as lead time, booking changes, deposit type, and customer type, amongst others. Data cleaning and preprocessing steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables. The data was then split into training and test sets for model development and evaluation.

## 📝 Methodology <a name="method"></a>
Three models were used in this project: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Neural Networks. These models were chosen due to their ability to handle binary classification problems. The models were trained on the training data and performance was evaluated on the test data using accuracy as the metric.

## 📈 Results <a name="results"></a>
The results of the project show the performance of the three models in predicting holiday cancellations. Detailed results and discussions are available in the project's Jupyter notebooks and reports.

## 🏁 Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
Predicting holiday cancellations can significantly help businesses in the hospitality industry in optimizing their operations and customer service. The models developed in this project provide a basis for such a prediction system, and the results provide insights into their performance and potential improvements.
